# ML_NoShow

This university project is aimed at creating an automated system capable of predicting whether or not a patient will show up at booked medical visits based on some personal information.
 
_Abstract_: <br>
Aquarela Advanced Analytics found that around 30% of patients do not show up for follow-up medical visits. The phenomenon can have different reasons, from the forgetting of the appointment to the lack of willingness to show up, even on the part of subjects suffering from different pathologies. Is it possible to predict whether a patient will show up for a medical examination or not? Starting from the Kaggle dataset “Medical appointment no show” from Kaggle we will try to verify this hypothesis.
